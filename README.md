## üëã Bio

I‚Äôm Clayton Carlson, an ambitious new grad from the University of Minnesota, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Data Science.

I‚Äôm passionate about machine learning and data analysis, and I‚Äôm excited to find a full-time position where I can further develop my skills and contribute to innovative projects.

In the last year, I've had the opportunity to innovate in the realm of generative AI. This is my current obsession; it's cutting-edge and super powerful. I plan to apply my skills in industry to improve lives. I‚Äôm also proficient in languages like Java and Python, and I have hands-on experience with cloud technologies such as AWS and database management using PostgreSQL. I'm currently learning to use Snowflake, as it's relevant for anyone interested in ML.

I was also a TA for a couple of years. I gave lectures once a week on linear algebra, and I loved it! I want to continue teaching throughout my career.
